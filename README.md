# Assignment Solutions by [Larry Madeo](https://twitter.com/larmalade)

**Welcome to Low-Level Programming!**

This repository contains my assignment solutions from the low-level programming 
track at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com).

**Whats in here?**

Each directory contains the code I created as I progressed through the
Holberton program. Each folder contains assignments on a given topic, each with
different specifications.  These are small scale assignments, each folder with a
one day timeline for completion. As such, the programs here are samples of my
work as time progressed. If you are interested in my work on larger-scale
projects, see some of my other repositories:
